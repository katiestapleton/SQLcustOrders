The csv database consists of three documents: customer information, customer orders, and order status. The SQL is used to create specific tables, primary/foreign keys, and various CRUD operations.

My SQL is near completion. Originally the code was written for a different database, which I not longer have assess to. However, I created my own CSV documents (including "blanks") to form another database. Due to its coding versatility, I am able to apply the previoys SQL to a different database/CSV documents. Right now I need to make some adjustments to the code to finalize the transfer.
